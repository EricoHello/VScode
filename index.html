		<h3>Experience 1</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Web Developer, Summit Transportatin, 2022-Present</li>
			<li>Have recently worked on a website project for a company where I applied my skills in web design and development. The project involved creating a custom WordPress website for the company to showcase their products and services. I started by gathering requirements from the client and creating wireframes and design mockups using tools like Figma and Adobe XD.

				Once the design was finalized, I began developing the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also utilized my knowledge of PHP to customize the WordPress theme to fit the client's specific needs. Throughout the development process, I regularly communicated with the client to ensure that their feedback was taken into account and incorporated into the final product.
				
				After completing the development, I conducted thorough testing to ensure that the website was responsive and functional on various devices and browsers. I also implemented search engine optimization techniques to improve the website's visibility and ranking on search engines.
				
				Overall, the project required a combination of technical and communication skills, as well as proficiency in WordPress development. I was able to successfully deliver a high-quality website that met the client's needs and exceeded their expectations.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Experience 2</h3>	
		<ul>
			<li>Middle After School Coding Teacher, After School All Stars, 2022-Present</li>
			<li>Teaching middle school students how to make a website was a truly rewarding experience for me. Watching them learn and grow their skills over the course of the program was inspiring. We began by introducing the basic concepts of web design, such as HTML and CSS, and gradually built up their knowledge and abilities.

				As we progressed, the students became more and more confident in their ability to design and develop their own websites. We covered topics like website layout, navigation, and usability, and the students began to create their own unique designs.
				
				One particularly memorable project involved having the students create a website about a topic they were passionate about. It was amazing to see the variety of topics they chose, from music to sports to animals, and how they incorporated their interests into the design of their websites.</li>
